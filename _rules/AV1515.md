rule-id: AV1515
title: Don't use "magic" numbers
severity: 1
---
Don't use literal values, either numeric or strings, in your code, other than to define symbolic constants. For example:

	public class Whatever  
	{
		public static readonly Color PapayaWhip = new Color(0xFFEFD5);
		public const int MaxNumberOfWheels = 18;
		public const byte ReadCreateOverwriteMask = 0b0010_1100;
	}

Strings intended for logging or tracing are exempt from this rule. Literals are allowed when their meaning is clear from the context, and not subject to future changes, For example:

	mean = (a + b) / 2; // okay  
	WaitMilliseconds(waitTimeInSeconds * 1000); // clear enough

If the value of one constant depends on the value of another, attempt to make this explicit in the code.

	public class SomeSpecialContainer  
	{  
		public const int MaxItems = 32;  
		public const int HighWaterMark = 3 * MaxItems / 4; // at 75%  
	}

**Note:** An enumeration can often be used for certain types of symbolic constants.
