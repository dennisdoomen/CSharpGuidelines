title: Use a common layout
severity: 1

- Keep the length of each line under 130 characters.

- Use an indentation of 4 spaces, and don't use tabs

- Keep one space between keywords like `if` and the expression, but don't add spaces after `(` and before `)` such as: `if (condition == null)`.

- Add a space around operators like `+`, `-`, `==`, etc.

- Always put opening and closing curly braces on a new line.

- Don't indent object/collection initializers and initialize each property on a new line, so use a format like this: 

		var dto = new ConsumerDto
		{
			Id = 123,
			Name = "Microsoft",
			PartnerShip = PartnerShip.Gold,
			ShoppingCart =
			{
				["VisualStudio"] = 1
			}
		};

- Don't indent lambda statement blocks and use a format like this:

		methodThatTakesAnAction.Do(x =>
		{ 
			// do something like this 
		}

- Keep expression-bodied-members on one line. Break long lines after the arrow sign, like this:

		private string GetLongText =>
			"ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC ABC";

- Put the entire LINQ statement on one line, or start each keyword at the same indentation, like this:

		var query = from product in products where product.Price > 10 select product;

  	or

		var query =  
		    from product in products  
		    where product.Price > 10  
		    select product;

- Start the LINQ statement with all the `from` expressions and don't interweave them with restrictions.
- Add parentheses around every binary expression, but don't add parentheses around unary expressions. For example `if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(str) && (str != "new"))`

- Add an empty line between multi-line statements, between multi-line members, after the closing curly braces, between unrelated code blocks, and between the `using` statements of different root namespaces.
