title: A class or interface should have a single purpose
severity: 1
---
A class or interface should have a single purpose within the system it functions in. In general, a class either represents a primitive type like an email or ISBN number, an abstraction of some business concept, a plain data structure, or is responsible for orchestrating the interaction between other classes. It is never a combination of those. This rule is widely known as the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html), one of the S.O.L.I.D. principles.

**Tip:** A class with the word `And` in it is an obvious violation of this rule.

**Tip:** Use [Design Patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)) to communicate the intent of a class. If you can't assign a single design pattern to a class, chances are that it is doing more than one thing.

**Note** If you create a class representing a primitive type you can greatly simplify its use by making it immutable.
