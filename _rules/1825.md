title: Prefer `Task.Run` or `Task.Factory.StartNew` for CPU-intensive activities
severity: 1
---
If you do need to execute a CPU bound operation, use `Task.Run` to offload the work to a thread from the Thread Pool. For long-running operations use `Task.Factory.StartNew` with `TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning` parameter to create a new thread. Remember that you have to marshal the result back to your main thread manually.
