title: Beware of `async`/`await` deadlocks in special environments (e.g. WPF)
severity: 1
---
Consider the following asynchronous method:

	private async Task GetDataAsync()
	{
		var result = await MyWebService.GetDataAsync();
		return result.ToString();
	}

Now when a button event handler is implemented like this:

	public async void Button1_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
		var data = GetDataAsync().Result;
		textBox1.Text = data;
	}

You will likely end up with a deadlock. Why? Because the `Result` property getter will block until the `async` operation has completed, but since an `async` method _could_ automatically marshal the result back to the original thread (depending on the current `SynchronizationContext` or `TaskScheduler`) and WPF uses a single-threaded synchronization context, they'll be waiting on each other. A similar problem can also happen on UWP, WinForms, classical ASP.NET (not ASP.NET Core) or a Windows Store C#/XAML app. Read more about this [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/await-and-ui-and-deadlocks-oh-my/).
