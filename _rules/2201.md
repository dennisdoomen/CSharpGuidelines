title: Use C# type aliases instead of the types from the `System` namespace
severity: 1
---
For instance, use `object` instead of `Object`, `string` instead of `String`, and `int` instead of `Int32`. These aliases have been introduced to make the primitive types first class citizens of the C# language, so use them accordingly. When referring to static members of those types, use `int.Parse()` instead of `Int32.Parse()`.

**Exception:** For interop with other languages, it is custom to use the [CLS-compliant name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/common-type-system) in type and member signatures, e.g. `HexToInt32Converter`, `GetUInt16`.
