title: Name a source file to the logical function of the partial type
severity: 3
---
When using partial types and allocating a part per file, name each file after the logical part that part plays. For example:

	// In MyClass.cs
	public partial class MyClass
	{...}
	
	// In MyClass.Designer.cs	
	public partial class MyClass
	{...}
