title: Don't expose stateful objects through static members
severity: 2
---
A stateful object is an object that contains many properties and lots of behavior behind it. If you expose such an object through a static property or method of some other object, it will be very difficult to refactor or unit test a class that relies on such a stateful object. In general, introducing a construct like that is a great example of violating many of the guidelines of this chapter.

A classic example of this is the `HttpContext.Current` property, part of ASP.NET. Many see the `HttpContext` class as a source of a lot of ugly code. In fact, the testing guideline [Isolate the Ugly Stuff](http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2005/10/21/haacked-on-tdd-and-jeremys-first-rule-of-tdd/) often refers to this class.
