- Use functional names. For example, `GetLength` is a better name than `GetInt`.
- Don't use terms like `Enum`, `Class` or `Struct` in a name.
- Identifiers that refer to a collection type should have plural names.
- Don't include the type in variable names, except to avoid clashes with other variables.
