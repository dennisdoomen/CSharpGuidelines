title: Use a protected virtual method to raise each event
severity: 2
---
Complying with this guideline allows derived classes to handle a base class event by overriding the protected method. The name of the protected virtual method should be the same as the event name prefixed with `On`. For example, the protected virtual method for an event named `TimeChanged` is named `OnTimeChanged`.

**Note:** Derived classes that override the protected virtual method are not required to call the base class implementation. The base class must continue to work correctly even if its implementation is not called.
