title: Properties, arguments and return values representing strings, collections or tasks should never be `null`
severity: 1
---
Returning `null` can be unexpected by the caller. Always return an empty collection or an empty string instead of a `null` reference. When your member returns `Task` or `Task<T>`, return `Task.CompletedTask` or `Task.FromResult()`. This also prevents cluttering your code base with additional checks for `null`, or even worse, `string.IsNullOrEmpty()`.
