title: Always add a `default` block after the last `case` in a `switch` statement
severity: 1
---
Add a descriptive comment if the `default` block is supposed to be empty. Moreover, if that block is not supposed to be reached throw an `InvalidOperationException` to detect future changes that may fall through the existing cases. This ensures better code, because all paths the code can travel have been thought about.

	void Foo(string answer)  
	{  
		switch (answer)  
		{  
			case "no":
			  Console.WriteLine("You answered with No");  
			  break;
			  
			case "yes":
			  Console.WriteLine("You answered with Yes");  
			  break;
			
			default:  
			  // Not supposed to end up here.  
			  throw new InvalidOperationException("Unexpected answer " + answer);
		}  
	}
