title: Throw exceptions rather than returning some kind of status value
severity: 2
---
A code base that uses return values to report success or failure tends to have nested if-statements sprinkled all over the code. Quite often, a caller forgets to check the return value anyway. Structured exception handling has been introduced to allow you to throw exceptions and catch or replace them at a higher layer. In most systems it is quite common to throw exceptions whenever an unexpected situation occurs.
