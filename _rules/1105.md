title: Use a method instead of a property
severity: 3
---
- If the work is more expensive than setting a field value. 
- If it represents a conversion such as the `Object.ToString` method.
- If it returns a different result each time it is called, even if the arguments didn't change. For example, the `NewGuid` method returns a different value each time it is called.
- If the operation causes a side effect such as changing some internal state not directly related to the property (which violates the [Command Query Separation](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html) principle). 

**Exception:** Populating an internal cache or implementing [lazy-loading](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/lazyLoad.html) is a good exception.
