title: Use `var` (implicit typing) and emphasize business purpose over mechanics
severity: 1
---
In almost all cases we recommend the use of var, to emphasizes the semantic "business purpose" of the variable and downplay the "mechanical" details of its storage (matching Domain Driven Design ubiquitous language principles).

    var amount = 2.1m;
    var referral = new Referral("jane.smith@acme.com");
    var discount = discountService.GetDiscountFromReferral(referral)
    var discountedAmount = discount.ApplyTo(amount);
    foreach(var discount in discountService.GetAll()) { ... }
    using(var discountService = serviceProvider.GetDiscountService()) { ... }

    etc.

Code should be written so that a variable provides a clear semantic pointer rather than reveal technical implementation details, unless these are somehow crucial. This also keeps code easier to read and refactor - change a method to return an interface instead of an object shouldn't matter to almost any code using that method. 

In addition, a list of variables using var aligns the variable names, which helps readability.

Always remember to use descriptive variable names regardless of whether you use "var". Variable names should represent the semantics of the variable, not details of its storage; "decimalRate" is bad; "interestRate" is good.

When you do use explicit typing
- Use explicit types if doing so is necessary for the code to be correctly understood and maintained and the technical details are crucial
- You need to call badly named methods you cannot refactor (though consider wrapping those!).
