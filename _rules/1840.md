title: Await `ValueTask` and `ValueTask<T>` directly and exactly once
severity: 1
---
The consumption of the newer and performance related `ValueTask` and `ValueTask<T>` types is more restrictive than consuming `Task` or `Task<T>`. Starting with .NET Core 2.1 the `ValueTask<T>` is not only able to wrap the result `T` or a `Task<T>`, with this version it is also possible to wrap a `IValueTaskSource` / `IValueTaskSource<T>` which gives the developer extra support for reuse and pooling. This enhanced support might lead to unwanted side-effects, as the ValueTask-returning developer might reuse the underlying object after it got awaited. The safest way to consume a `ValueTask` / `ValueTask<T>` is to directly `await` it once, or call `.AsTask()` to get a `Task` / `Task<T>` to overcome these limitations.

	// OK / GOOD
	int bytesRead = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, cancellationToken);

	// OK / GOOD
	int bytesRead = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);

	// OK / GOOD - Get task if you want to overcome the limitations exposed by ValueTask / ValueTask<T>
	Task<int> task = stream.ReadAsync(buffer, cancellationToken).AsTask();

Other usage patterns might still work (like saving the `ValueTask` / `ValueTask<T>` into a variable and awaiting later), but may lead to misuse eventually. Not awaiting a `ValueTask` / `ValueTask<T>` may also cause unwanted side-effects.
