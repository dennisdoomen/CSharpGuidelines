title: Use an interface to decouple classes from each other
severity: 2
---
Interfaces are a very effective mechanism for decoupling classes from each other:

- They can prevent bidirectional associations; 
- They simplify the replacement of one implementation with another; 
- They allow the replacement of an expensive external service or resource with a temporary stub for use in a non-production environment.
- They allow the replacement of the actual implementation with a dummy implementation or a fake object in a unit test; 
- Using a dependency injection framework you can centralize the choice of which class is used whenever a specific interface is requested.
