title: Don't declare signatures with more than 3 parameters
severity: 1
---
To keep constructors, methods, delegates and local functions small and focused, do not use more than three parameters. Do not use tuple parameters. Do not return tuples with more than two elements.

If you want to use more parameters, use a structure or class to pass multiple arguments, as explained in the [Specification design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern).
In general, the fewer the parameters, the easier it is to understand the method. Additionally, unit testing a method with many parameters requires many scenarios to test.

**Exception:** A parameter that is a collection of tuples is allowed.
