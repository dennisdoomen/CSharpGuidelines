title: It should be possible to treat a derived object as if it were a base class object
severity: 2
---
In other words, you should be able to use a reference to an object of a derived class wherever a reference to its base class object is used without knowing the specific derived class. A very notorious example of a violation of this rule is throwing a `NotImplementedException` when overriding some of the base-class methods. A less subtle example is not honoring the behavior expected by the base class.   
  
**Note:** This rule is also known as the Liskov Substitution Principle, one of the [S.O.L.I.D.](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx) principles.
