title: Return interfaces to unchangeable collections
severity: 2
---
You generally don't want callers to be able to change an internal collection, so don't return arrays, lists or other collection classes directly. Instead, return an `IEnumerable<T>`, `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`, `IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IReadOnlySet<T>` or `IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>`.

**Exception:** Immutable collections such as `ImmutableArray<T>`, `ImmutableList<T>` and `ImmutableDictionary<TKey, TValue>` prevent modifications from the outside and are thus allowed.
