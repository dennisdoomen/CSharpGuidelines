title: Encapsulate complex expressions in a property, method or local function
severity: 1

Consider the following example:

	if (member.HidesBaseClassMember && (member.NodeType != NodeType.InstanceInitializer))
	{
		// do something
	}

In order to understand what this expression is about, you need to analyze its exact details and all of its possible outcomes. Obviously, you can add an explanatory comment on top of it, but it is much better to replace this complex expression with a clearly named method:

	if (NonConstructorMemberUsesNewKeyword(member))  
	{  
		// do something
	}  
  
  
	private bool NonConstructorMemberUsesNewKeyword(Member member)  
	{  
		return
			member.HidesBaseClassMember &&
			(member.NodeType != NodeType.InstanceInitializer);
	}

You still need to understand the expression if you are modifying it, but the calling code is now much easier to grasp.
