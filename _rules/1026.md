title: Classes should protect the consistency of their internal state
severity: 1

Validate incoming arguments from public members. For example:

	public void SetAge(int years)
	{
		AssertValueIsInRange(years, 0, 200, nameof(years));

		this.age = years;
	}

Protect invariants on internal state. For example:

	public void Render()
	{
		AssertNotDisposed();

		// ...
	}
