title: Consider using `Any()` to determine whether an `IEnumerable<T>` is empty
severity: 3
---
When a member or local function returns an `IEnumerable<T>` or other collection class that does not expose a `Count` property, use the `Any()` extension method rather than `Count()` to determine whether the collection contains items. If you do use `Count()`, you risk that iterating over the entire collection might have a significant impact (such as when it really is an `IQueryable<T>` to a persistent store).

**Note:** If you return an `IEnumerable<T>` to prevent changes from calling code as explained in [AV1130](/member-design-guidelines#av1130), and you're developing in .NET 4.5 or higher, consider the new read-only classes.
