title: Call the more overloaded method from other overloads
severity: 2
---
This guideline only applies to overloads that are intended to provide optional arguments. Consider, for example, the following code snippet:

	public class MyString  
	{
		private string someText;
		
		public int IndexOf(string phrase)  
		{  
			return IndexOf(phrase, 0); 
		}
		
		public int IndexOf(string phrase, int startIndex)  
		{  
			return IndexOf(phrase, startIndex, someText.Length - startIndex);
		}
		
		public virtual int IndexOf(string phrase, int startIndex, int count)  
		{  
			return someText.IndexOf(phrase, startIndex, count);
		}  
	}

The class `MyString` provides three overloads for the `IndexOf` method, but two of them simply call the one with one more parameter. Notice that the same rule applies to class constructors; implement the most complete overload and call that one from the other overloads using the `this()` operator. Also notice that the parameters with the same name should appear in the same position in all overloads.

**Important:** If you also want to allow derived classes to override these methods, define the most complete overload as a non-private `virtual` method that is called by all overloads.
